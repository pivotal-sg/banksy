EventSourcing (our take on ES!) ... some notes on architecture ...

- An aggregate is a representations of an entity, or group of tightly interrelated entities.
- Aggregates may publish events (not dispatch commands)
- dispatcher of a Command receives a CommandResult<T>
- Event Publishing does NOT generate an EventResult<T>
- Communication directly between Aggregates IS ILLEGAL!
- Aggregates apply events after publishing them to the Event Log
