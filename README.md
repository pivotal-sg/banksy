# Banksy

An example bank account app for EventSourcing and CQRS.

## Notes

We gathered ideas from existing literature and examples, in an attempt to discover
best practices for building an Event Sourced application.

We are not 100% on some implementation details, based on information
we've found, so some parts are implemented in ways which
"feel" best, or _just work for now_.

As such this example should be considered one opinion among many.

## Dependencies

- Google Guava - EventBus
- Spring / Spring Boot
